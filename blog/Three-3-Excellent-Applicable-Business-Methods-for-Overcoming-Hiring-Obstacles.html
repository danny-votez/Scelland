                        <h4><em>All signs point to the labor market tightening further and longer, which is why it's critical to seek alternatives to traditional recruiting.</em></h4>
                        <hr>
                        <img alt="blog.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-left blog-inner" src="img/home-19.jpg" />

                        <p>You're not alone if you're having trouble filling available roles as an entrepreneur. Unfilled job positions have reached a record level, according to the National Federation of Independent Business's Small Business Report, with 92 percent of business owners indicating that their job advertisements have drawn little or no candidates. </p>

                        <p>Because it's becoming increasingly difficult to fill unfilled positions, it's time to investigate these three alternatives to traditional hiring. </p>

                        <h3><strong>1. Consider the big picture</strong></h3>
                        <p>The United States accounts for one-quarter of the world's 1.3 billion English speakers, although it is exceeded by English-speaking citizens of Pakistan, India, and the Philippines, all of whom have a large pool of competent job searchers.</p>

                        <p>You can fill your roles with experienced, educated team members from outside our borders by looking beyond our borders. Millions of college-educated job searchers are eager to help you expand your business â€” and they'll also help you boost your bottom line, as average earnings for skilled persons in developing countries are often 50% to 80% lower than comparable rates in the United States.</p>

                        <p>It's now easier than ever to find remote offshore talent. You can hire suitable team members by posting ads on freelancing websites or hiring a business-process-outsourcing organization, sometimes known as a "BPO."</p>

                        <p>Working directly with an overseas freelancer is typically less expensive and more flexible than working with a BPO, especially if you have less than 10 staff. If you need more size and dependability, a credible BPO can offer you with vetted, full-time resources who operate from their secure premises and report to an overseas manager. BPOs typically charge a monthly cost per full-time equivalent employee or a unit-based fee; in either case, you'll pay a higher price than if you hired directly. </p>

                        <p>Whether you're seeking for competent developers, accountants, receptionists, data-entry clerks, customer-service representatives, or marketing specialists, if you're ready to "go global," you'll almost certainly find what you need. </p>

                        <h3><strong>2. Adopt a technological mindset</strong></h3>
                        <p>Rather than human resources, technology may be the most effective answer to many of your resource gaps. In fact, artificial intelligence (AI), robotic process automation (RPA), and other technological technologies are enabling many business owners to overcome operational issues and provide superior customer service. Existing processes and workflows can also be streamlined, reducing the workload of your current workforce. </p>

                        <p>According to McKinsey & Company, three-quarters of organizations are automating one or more of their business activities, or will be in the near future. Those who succeed with automation do so by recognizing it as a critical strategic objective and then systematically addressing it through a close collaboration between internal operations and IT stakeholders. As a result, they're improving operational efficiency and putting themselves in a better position to drive growth while minimizing their reliance on human resources. </p>

                        <p>RPA, which is used to automate repetitive, high-volume processes, is one tool that is gaining traction in the automation field. RPA has been used by IT teams for years, but it has now matured into a simple-to-implement solution that requires little or no code, making it accessible to non-IT purchasers. In fact, business buyers with little or no IT experience will account for a large portion of its near-term development. </p>

                        <p>Application-programming interfaces (APIs), which decrease human data entry and enable business managers to harness the power of heterogeneous systems and their linked data, are another popular tech tool. Similarly, deployable bots are handling a growing share of level one customer service, and AI-enabled software is being employed by enterprises of all sizes to lessen their dependency on administrative support personnel, developers, accountants, lawyers, and other costly human resources. </p>

                        <p>Although software may not be the only solution to all of your staffing problems, the most up-to-date technological tools can undoubtedly assist in resolving many of your resource issues and providing additional support to your team. </p>

                        <h3><strong>3. Enlist the help of a strategic partner.</strong></h3>
                        <p>Successful company executives understand their core talents and surround themselves with partners who can handle the areas in which they are lacking. </p>
                        <img alt="blog.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right blog-inner" src="img/home-20.jpg" />

                        <p>Consider forming a strategic relationship with a company that has demonstrated skill in a field that isn't your primary competency. Consider outsourcing a piece of your customer-support function to a company that excels in providing such support across many channels if you run a service business. Consider working with an experienced billing company that charges a success-based fee rather than incurring internal, fixed personnel costs if you run a medical practice. Consider a third-party lead generation or telemarketing company that charges lead-based and conversion-based fees if you offer goods or services and rely on an internal telemarketing staff that produces poor results. </p>

                        <p>Regardless of the type of assistance you require, there is almost certainly a business partner in the marketplace who is hyper-focused on the skills you require. Best of all, unlike onboarding a new hire, these collaborations frequently need far less ramp-up time and are much more cost-effective. </p>

                        <p>All signs point to the labor market tightening further and longer, which is why it's critical to seek alternatives to traditional recruiting. To supplement your talent acquisition plan, look beyond our borders, embrace technology, and choose a third-party partner with demonstrated competence and skill. </p>
