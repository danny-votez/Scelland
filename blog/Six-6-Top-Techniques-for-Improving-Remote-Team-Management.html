                        <h4><em>In the current competitive and goal-oriented business environment, managing a remote software development team is challenging, and it takes time and effort. However, the benefits of executing it correctly can be enormous.</em></h4>
                        <hr>
                        <img class="img-responsive pull-left blog-inner" src="img/home-21.jpg" alt="Remote Teams">
                        <p>Managing a remote software development team is challenging, and it takes time and effort. The benefits of doing it successfully, on the other hand, can be enormous, and it's not as difficult as some businesses may believe.</p>
                        
                        <p>Almost every corporation, especially huge IT firms, has grappled with distant work connections in the post-pandemic era. Some, such as Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), have reacted positively to the changes, seeing the potential benefits for both the companies and their employees.</p>
                        
                        <p>We spoke with Boris Sabotovich, a project and delivery expert at EPAM Anywhere Business, a global software development company. In this interview, he discusses how to easily set up a work flow and manage existing projects with minimal effort, as well as other important aspects of working with a remote workforce.</p>
                        
                        <h3><strong>Question? What Is The Best Place To Begin When Managing A Remote Team?</strong></h3>
                        <p>Having a well established policy for all employees, whether remote or in-house, is essential. Every team member will know what to do, how to do it, and what your expectations as a manager are if you have a policy in place.</p>
                        
                        <p>It establishes objective standards that apply equally to all employees and ensures delivery quality. Creating a policy, in my experience, may assist firms in forming a strong and efficient remote team that operates easily and dependably. </p>
                        
                        <h3><strong>One of the most common concerns among businesses is a lack of contact and communication. What Is The Most Effective Way To Deal With This?</strong></h3>
                        <p>Regular meetings may appear to be an antiquated management technique, but when utilized effectively, they can bring your team together and increase morale as well as the quality of their work.</p>
                        
                        <p>The key to making the most of frequent meetings is to plan ahead of time. As a result, make sure the agenda and your expectations are clear ahead of time so that everyone knows what will be discussed and how they should participate.</p>
                        
                        <img class="img-responsive pull-right blog-inner" src="img/home-22.jpg" alt="Remote Teams">
                        
                        <p>Divide your meetings into multiple components to keep your employees engaged: a welcome message, a meeting agenda, personal reports, and planning for future responsibilities. In addition to arranging the meeting into logical sections, have team members take turns giving information; this will make everyone feel more involved in the process and invested in a good end.</p>
                        
                        <p>Remember to be specific about your communication methods as well. Everyone on your team, whether they work remotely or not, should know who to contact if they have a problem; this will enhance general team communication and keep your meetings on track.</p>
                        
                        <p>Don't forget to leave time during meetings for casual discussion and team bonding. This will not happen on its own when people work remotely.</p>
                        
                        <h3><strong>When it comes to managing a remote team, can management tools make a difference?</strong></h3>
                        <p>You can't and shouldn't keep all of the information you need in your head at all times. Managers often have a lot on their plates, so think about how you can make the most of your time. As a result, a vital rule: let technology assist you, as well-chosen technology can assist your entire team.</p>
                        
                        <p>Management software is essential because it can combine all pertinent data and make it available to everyone, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to accommodate various time zones. It can be used to ensure that your objectives are clear and to track everyone's progress so that you can see at a glance whether your project is on track or whether resources need to be reassigned.</p>
                        
                        <p>Because every member of the team has access to the project management tool, communication can improve because everyone is aware of the project's status, task completion, and what is expected of them next. Keep everyone on task and on track by updating your projects on a regular basis.</p>
                        
                        <h3><strong>Technology can have both a bringing together and a separating effect on team members. What is the best way to deal with this?</strong></h3>
                        <p>Workers who work from home may experience emotions of loneliness or separation. As a result, it's critical that you assist your employees in remaining connected through frequent meetings, online resources, chat threads, and video chats. Written communication is by nature dry and devoid of emotional context. Make an effort to use a cheerful, happy tone.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the virtual environment, where remote employees may feel cut off from in-house teams, team member appreciation is particularly critical. During the course of a project, pointing out little and significant successes can help everyone remember how vital their contribution to the process is. It is critical for successful work to maintain a congenial and supportive environment for all employees.</p>
                        
                        <h3><strong>Technical issues might sabotage a company's efforts to manage remote teams. What are your thoughts on this?</strong></h3>
                        <p>It's critical for your staff to have the right technology, connectivity, and resources to complete their work efficiently. You may build trust and a sense of belonging by ensuring these conditions.<p>
                        
                        <p>One of the five keys to achieving employee expectations, according to the Workplace Survey 2019, is connectivity. Given the following figures I gathered, improving connectivity is an issue for employers. For work outside the office:-</p>
                        <ul class="list-group">
                            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">52% of remote workers utilize a company-supplied computer;</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning">39% use a virtual private network (VPN);</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">36% use cloud file management tools;</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info">34% use instant messaging services; and </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">13% use groupware or business collaboration software.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>When dealing with a remote support team, it's critical that they're all linked and using the same cloud system. This gives the entire team access to current information and allows them to create a pleasant client experience. Furthermore, it is far more safe and trustworthy than having data fragmented.</p>
                        
                        <p>Because it makes work easier and boosts productivity, a cloud-based sales CRM will allow you to improve the customer experience by managing the connection and increasing the team experience.</p>
                        
                        <h3><strong>What is your last piece of advice for managing a remote team?</strong></h3>
                        <p>It is critical for a strong team to have fun in between job obligations. Even when you're separated by a large geographical distance, you can still meet for coffee, chat, and learn more about the team. One alternative for team members is to set up a separate "fun chat" where they can discuss viral memes, movie recommendations, and fantastic songs.</p>
                        
                        <p>Remember that even this casual talk must be work-appropriate, so everyone should be aware of the need of adhering to workplace communication norms.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, following these few simple guidelines for managing remote teams will make your job easier, and it will most likely only necessitate minor changes to your overall work management procedure. That way, you may efficiently lead your remote workforce and get the finest outcomes while providing excellent support to your clients.</p>
