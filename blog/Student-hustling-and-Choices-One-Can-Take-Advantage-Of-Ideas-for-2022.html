                        <p>What can you do to make money while in university? Well, the possibilities are endless! In this blog post, we will explore some of the best side hustles for students. Including tutoring, blogging and motorbike couriering. Each opportunity is unique and has its own set of pros and cons. We hope that through this blog post we can give you a few ideas on how to generate income to pay off those student loans! </p>
                        <h3><strong>Tutoring</strong></h3>
                        <p>Let’s start easy. Tutoring is the obvious side hustle for those who are in school or university due to the expertise you are gaining in your chosen subjects. Whether you’re studying English or Science, speak a second language, play a sport at a high level or have gained qualifications playing a particular musical instrument, why not be paid a bit of money to pass on your skills and knowledge. Tutoring opportunities are likely available through your school or you can set up your own private service, to have greater flexibility with time and costs, which you can promote via a website and social media. You can even tutor online to better fit around your schedule! Tutoring may seem like the obvious choice because it is such a popular option but if you are able to organise your time and resources well, then it is a great way to supplement your own learning, while helping other students and earning a bit of cash! </p>
                        <h3><strong>Babysitting</strong></h3>
                        <p>Babysitting is another highly flexible side hustle that is handy for students. Whether you live on campus or at home, there are likely babysitting opportunities in your area. An easy way to get jobs is to create profiles on babysitter websites or simply advertise your services on your social media accounts. If you are responsible and good with children then why not give it a try? Chances are you will only need to work evenings or weekends, leaving the rest of your time free to study and do the activities you enjoy. The great thing about babysitting is that you can (with the parents permission of course) also use your hobbies to your advantage in this line of work. If you love films and tv, take the kids you are minding to see a movie or if you enjoy being out in nature, visit the park. The more you put in the more you will get out and the more you work the more you will earn. </p>
                        <h3><strong>Blogging</strong></h3>
                        <p>If you are a talented writer then why not start your own blog? This is a fun way of putting your literacy skills to good use and an added bonus of writing for your own blog is that you are entirely in control of the content and topics that you cover. If you are stuck for ideas then student blogs are very popular and will likely never go out of fashion. As a student you already possess all the necessary knowledge to put out good content. Simply write about your experiences or tips you have learnt during your time at university.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Motorbike courier</strong></h3>
                        <p>I think as a student, we all make use of delivery services in some form or another! With e-commerce and food delivery services such as Deliveroo and Just Eat surging in popularity due to the pandemic, there are a huge number of opportunities available for delivery drivers. If you have a license, then why not give motorbike couriering a shot? This is an exciting side hustle for students who want to get out and about and love to drive. Depending on where you live and your driving experience, you can earn great money delivering much needed packages to customers. This is a very unique side hustle for students that provides great experience and freedom.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Sell crafts</strong></h3>
                        <p>If you are a creative type with a bit of free time on your hands, then selling art, jewellery or crafts online is a great side hustle. Whether you love painting, printing, photography or carpentry, websites such as Etsy make it very easy for artists and designers to sell their work to like minded individuals all over the world. This is the perfect student side hustle as it can be done from home and whenever you feel like it. There are certain sites that may charge you to sell on them, however, there are also a number of free to use channels upon which to promote your work. Do some research and see what works best for you. What makes this such a great opportunity is that you can set your own working hours and prices.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Selling your unwanted items</strong></h3>
                        <p>Similarly, why not sell your unwanted clothes and items? As a student it is very easy to accumulate new clothes from events or items from freshers and careers fairs. If you are holding onto any quality items that you no longer have a use for, then why not make an account on a secondhand selling site such as Depop, Vinted or Facebook Marketplace and give your unwanted items a new home. Not only will this clear out your clutter but also earn you a bit of cash in the process. You might also enjoy upcycling old clothes or furniture and selling them here too! </p>
                        <h3><strong>Baking</strong></h3>
                        <p>If you are a keen baker in your spare time then why not earn a bit of cash from your hobby. Selling cookies or cupcakes is a fun and tasty side hustle for students with a bit of culinary skill. If you are very competent in the kitchen then why not take orders from family and friends for occasion cakes such as birthday or graduation cakes. You may even find that there is an opportunity at university events to supply and sell your creations. </p>
                        <h3><strong>Start a YouTube Channel</strong></h3>
                        <p>If you are looking for a fun student side hustle that you can do in your spare time and show off all the things you enjoy then you should consider starting a YouTube channel! StudyTube is a popular concept on YouTube that encompasses creator videos focused around study hacks, university tips and general informative content about student life. However, your YouTube channel doesn’t necessarily have to be student related, you can make content on anything from sports to films to makeup to general lifestyle – the possibilities are endless! The only drawback is that making money from YouTube takes quite a bit of time and dedication. It is possible with sponsors and affiliate links but you will have to be enthusiastic and committed in order to achieve these. </p>
                        <h3><strong>Become an extra in a TV or film production</strong></h3>
                        <p>This may not be the biggest money maker but if you are interested in TV and film, this is a fantastic way to get some experience in the industry while having loads of fun! The easiest way to achieve this is to sign up to an extras agency. You can take on as many or little opportunities as you like depending on what you’re interested in and how much free time you have, just create your account, sit back and watch the roles fly in! </p>
                        <p>These side hustles all have varying benefits and can be tailored around the activities and topics that you are most passionate about. Once you have decided which option is right for you, take some time to research how best to fit your side hustle into your daily schedule and start making quick money in a short amount of time! </p>
                        <p>Have any more interesting or profitable student side hustles? Let us know! We are always keen to hear your ideas.</p>
