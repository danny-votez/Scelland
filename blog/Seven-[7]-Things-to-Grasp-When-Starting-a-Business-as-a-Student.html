							Seven [7] Things to Grasp When Starting a Business as a Student
						</h1>
						<h4><b>Getting Yourself Out There, Dollar at a Time</b></h4>
						<hr>
						<img
							alt="blog.jpg"
							class="img-responsive pull-right blog-inner"
							src="img/home-6.jpg"
						/>
						<p>
							You know how the story goes. People like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill
							Gates founded their now-multinational corporations while they were
							in college. So, why don’t you try to start a business and turn it
							into a money-maker, too?
						</p>
						<p>
							There’s nothing wrong with being inspired by such stories. But
							your decision to become an entrepreneur should be a well-weighed
							one. After all, you’ll be investing your time, effort, and money
							into making it work.
						</p>
						<p>
							Plus, venturing into the business world with zero preparation
							whatsoever might not be the best idea. But as for this part,
							consider yourself covered.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<strong>Your priorities should be clear from the get-go</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
							Running a business is akin to a full-time job – except there’s no
							40-hour week rule. You might think, “Oh, it’s great, I’ll be able
							to work less and still earn a living!”. But that’s rarely the
							reality.
						</p>
						<p>
							The truth is, you shouldn’t expect to earn money from the get-go.
							And don’t expect to be able to treat it as a hobby. You’re likely
							to end up working on your venture day and night, leaving little
							time for parties and even studies.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some might say it’s completely possible to juggle college and
							business. But it’s hard to agree with it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Creating a viable product, testing, and improving it alone will
							require a tremendous effort. And, your customers are unlikely to
							cut you any slack because you have that coursework to finish.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, decide early on how you’re going to manage your time.
							Sacrifices will have to be made. Usually, it means you’ll have to
							set aside some money for professional paper writer services, quit
							extracurriculars if you have to. And cut down on partying, of
							course.
						</p>
						<h3><strong>Use classes for your business’s benefit</strong></h3>
						<p>
							If your major and/or minor are related to the industry or business
							administration in general, use it. Put to practice the theory that
							you learn in those classes right away.
						</p>
						<p>
							Plus, your professors are very knowledgeable. So, don’t hesitate
							to raise your hand (or approach them after classes) and ask them
							questions related to your business. Their knowledge and experience
							is an invaluable resource at your disposal.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you don’t have such classes in your curriculum yet, worry not.
							You can still find electives that would tackle the whole ‘running
							a business’ ordeal.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this case, the advice remains the same. Treat the theory as the
							basis for practice, use it in the real-world setting, and ask as
							many business-related questions as possible.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<strong
								>Your Alma mater has plenty of resources to help you</strong
							>
						</h3>
						<p>
							This is one of the main reasons why college students are in the
							best spot for starting their own enterprise. There are just so
							many resources available to you simply because you’re a student!
						</p>
						<p>
							Here’s just a quick overview of what you can benefit from thanks
							to your alma mater:
						</p>
						<ul class="list-group" >
							<li>Free Wi-Fi;</li>
							<li>Free meeting spaces, coworking’s, and hubs;</li>
							<li>Library materials;</li>
							<li>
								Student discounts on some products and services, especially on
								software;
							</li>
							<li>Orientation sessions and advisors;</li>
							<li>Business plan competitions;</li>
							<li>Fairs and networking events;</li>
							<li>Incubator and mentorship programs.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>
							<strong
								>Even the coolest product is nothing without customers</strong
							>
						</h3>
						<p>
							Before you invest a substantial amount of money into your venture,
							make sure you have a customer base to sell your product to. How?
							Two words: market research.
						</p>
						<p>
							Yes, it sounds a bit boring (especially if you’re not a
							facts-and-figures type of person). But it’s necessary: you need to
							know there’s a demand for what you have to offer. If you don’t,
							you risk becoming one of that 42% of small businesses that fail
							because they have no market for their product.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here’s what you should take into account when compiling your
							market research notes:
						</p>
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item active">
								Your buyer persona’s characteristics: age, location, job titles,
								etc.;
							</li>
							<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">Their challenges, preferences, and habits;</li>
							<li class="list-group-item active">Direct and indirect competitors.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Here’s a tip on the ‘how’ of market research: stats are important,
							but so is talking to your potential customers. So, get in the room
							with them and discuss whether they have this problem you want to
							address and what they think of your product.
						</p>
						<h3><strong>Testing any product is vital</strong></h3>
						<p>
							Most genius business ideas weren’t a result of a Eureka moment
							that struck the entrepreneur while they were taking a shower. No,
							those ideas were a product of many cycles of trial and error.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, the initial idea must be viable, at least. But then
							you’ll have to go through this cycle several times before you have
							a truly great product:
							<li>
								Getting a version of the prototype or minimum viable product
								ready to be tested;
							</li>
							<li>
								Presenting it to a focus group and listening to the feedback:
								what works and what doesn’t;
							</li>
							<li>Improving the product – and repeating.</li>
						</p>
						<h3>
							<strong>You don’t have to venture into this on your own</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
							Do you know what makes it so much easier to get started and keep
							going on the entrepreneurial journey? Having someone to bounce
							your ideas off, give you feedback, share their time-tested
							know-how with you, or even partner up with. This is where
							networking kicks in. And people of all kinds are more inclined to
							help out a student. Here’s just a quick overview of who you might
							want to approach:
						</p>
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item active">
								Peers: they can become your partners, co-founders, or your focus
								group;
							</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">
								Alums: they can fund your start-up, share their experience with
								you, or even become your mentors;
							</li>
							<li class="list-group-item active">
								Professors: typically, they are a well of knowledge, and they
								don’t mind helping their students out;
							</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">
								Successful entrepreneurs: they’re more than ready to get their
								brains picked by students.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							So, go ahead and find yourself a mentor. This person will guide
							you in your journey using their real-world experience – and
							they’ll help you avoid many pitfalls and mistakes rookies have no
							idea of.
						</p>
						<h3><strong>Overnight success is a myth</strong></h3>
						<p>
							Becoming a huge success overnight is just a pipe dream that has
							nothing in common with the reality of entrepreneurship. Prepare
							for the possibility that, despite long hours and exhaustion, you
							won’t succeed. Not every start-up breaks even – in fact, around
							three-quarters of new businesses don’t manage to become
							sustainable.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, be realistic about your chances and goals. Don’t expect to
							earn tens of thousands of dollars in a couple of months of hard
							work. Expect to keep grinding, instead – resilience is key here.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<strong>College is a great time to become an entrepreneur</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
							College is arguably the best time to get in on the
							entrepreneurship game. You’re not bound by a bunch of commitments
							yet, especially in terms of finances. You have plenty of free or
							almost free resources to boost your chances of success at your
							disposal. In a nutshell, your risks are low while your potential
							reward is high.
						</p>
						<p>
							In other words, it’s worth trying. If you make it, you won’t have
							to worry about finding a job after graduation. If you don’t,
							you’ll still have invaluable experience to put on your resume.
							Plus, this will make you more mature, and fast. That’s a priceless
							acquisition in and of itself.
