                        </h1>
                        <h4>“Start, yes, start today”</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <img alt="blog.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right blog-inner" src="img/home-2.jpg" />
                        <p><b> It is Time to Know Theyself</b></p>
                            <br />
                        <p>Should I start, or should we start? Yes, 
                            that is the first and foremost reason to have a blog. With the changing world, we are craving a way to communicate our ideas and feelings. As such, the possession of an avenue in making this aspect a success is essential. Getting people to understand us is pegged with multiple demands. This means, with a need to make one visible, setting aside the time and write what lies in one’s mind is essential.</p>
                        <p>There is a saying, “Rome was not built in a day.” What comes to mind is the effort put forward towards the successful realization of the Roman empire. Given this aspect, we must recognize how making daily efforts is essential towards complete mastery. Despite Rome not being built in a day, a lot was going on, including the “Laying of Bricks Every Hour.” What does this mean? One might ask, and then the answer comes in place, it is the steps that need to be taken towards reaching the epitome of the Roman Empire.</p>
                        <p>As a student, one might feel they possess the lengthy timeline that school gives them, as defined in the program one is taking. However, just as the first day ended without much pressure on that day one came to the institution, within time, one realizes that their time has also passed, either for the 4-year program, 6-year program, and others. Growing one’s skills is paramount as a student, meaning Blogging can offer the right avenue in supporting your goals. One might say, but I am not a writer. The hard truth is, No one is ever a writer, and they cannot know unless they put their actions in place.</p>
                        <p>In the flying time and a need to establish oneself in the coming job market, entrepreneurship, and other endeavors that nature brings forth, below are some essential items that make it vital to start blogging as early as possible.</p>
                        <h3><strong>#1: It Helps You to Understand Yourself</strong></h3>
                        <p>You are indeed alone as you are writing your blog or any other piece of writing. This simple aspect is crucial and holds power to know oneself deeper than anyone else can. There is power in writing, and compared to other socialization events or the mere indulgence in TV watching, taking time to write goes beyond the transfer of words from one’s head onto their writing pads or PC. It starts with an inner feeling, which culminates in much larger self-awareness concepts.</p>
                        <p>At the start, it might feel like a challenge and a massive struggle inside oneself. Yet with time, there is the overall transformation of the entire process and the improvement in oneself. As one writes, there is the overall effort in place that comes from the multiple aspects of their lives, which promotes the understanding of oneself. Putting words down allows you to reflect on yourself and see the world from only your perspective. Rather than the noisy scenario seen in watching things on TV or reading another writer’s blog or book, which in these scenarios there is delving in their world, writing personal blogs brings the scene closer home, and the words that come out are from within.</p>
                        <img src="img/home-15.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-left blog-inner" alt="">
                        <!-- Understanding Oneself Holds Unimaginable Power -->
                        <p>As an individual, personal writing is highly essential in supporting the personal growth one needs. And as early as one starts to understand themselves, more power will arise when we face the world. So,…………….Start Today,……….Start Now!</p>
                        
                        <h3><strong>#2: It Helps You to Understand the World</strong></h3>
                        <p>Life is not only about “Me.” There is also “Us” and “We” spread across the multiple domains on this globe. The need to feel special might arise, yet this is nothing compared to making an impact that the wonderful world can also experience. Thus, as a student, having a blog forms an essential platform for communicating one’s ideas and even those of others to the broader world. Rather than the inherent aspect where one becomes focused on themselves [which is very good sometimes], writing for a global audience acts as a benchmark towards creating international relationships, even though some might never be physical.</p>
                        <p>Compared to the simplified communication that only occurs within the classroom with fellow learners, taking a broader globalized perspective helps support personal growth. One can thus become a global thinker from localized thinking and shift their communication and tone towards an international community. The need to maneuver the global scene when one leaves college is high, and this must start with understanding how to talk to the world. With a personalized blog and the delivery of quality content that resonates with the broader community, there is setting oneself in a market that appreciates talent and simplicity through the written word.</p>
                        <p>Looking to the outside through the global perspective in one’s blog is also pivotal in becoming an international change maker. The rise of the internet has resulted in millions of people accessing millions of content from millions of places worldwide. As such, the fact that one writes holds power in supporting or influencing someone across the globe or on an island somewhere far away. In essence, you become a global change maker through your personalized Blogging.</p>
                        <p>They say the world has become a global village. Yes, it has, and it will only continue to be a global village by hearing about “YOU” through your blog.</p>
                        
                        <h3><strong>#3: It is an Avenue to Showcase Your Skills</strong></h3>
                        <p>Everyone’s destiny has its uniqueness. And through the power of the word, people’s lives have been changed throughout the wider globe. As a student, the school community possesses multiple activities, of which different students find joy in engaging. However, despite the existence of these activities, one can understand that not all persons will fall within the same hobby during their schooling period. This makes it vital for exploiting the power of Blogging, which can help one understand themselves and set the pace for personal growth with time.</p>
                        <p>Through daily practice and the subsequent delivery of content to the world, Blogging is an excellent place to allow one to sharpen their writing skills, communication skills, grammar skills, and public speaking skills. In this process, there is taking the personal initiative of passing helpful information from one’s mind and experience to the wider world for their consumption. In a significant way, rather than sitting on one’s ideas, blogging, in this case, offers the opportunity to reach out to a broader community and explain oneself through the written word.</p>
                        <p>There is the potential of improving ones writing, and one day might lead to writing a complete book. Moreover, different careers in the industry that rely on writing, e.g., content writing, speech writing, the starting of a personal blog, and continued practice, can allow one to sharpen their skills. Similarly, the use of the keyboard sometimes can be challenging for some. However, as a blogger, it means there will be massive times one is forced to use their PCs or Laptops for typing. This is also an excellent learning avenue, as through this process, typing speed increases and the understanding of the keyboard layout.</p>
                        <p>All these and other aspects just depict how essential personal blogging is for personal growth and as an avenue towards improving oneself in preparation for the outside world. Go! Go! Go!</p>
                        <img src="img/home-16.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right blog-inner" alt="blog image">
                        
                        <h3><strong>#4: It is Your First Essential Resume to All Employers Out There</strong></h3>
                        <p>The job market has changed, and employers have shifted from the traditional tools used in hiring. One reason for the shift is that the majority can exhibit the conventional aspects, which makes the selection criteria challenging. However, with the adoption of key differentiating factors and activities, employers have the power to understand how skilled and globalized their employees are. The possession of a personal blog, and one which contains worthy information worthy reading, can form the basis for raising an employer’s interest.</p>
                        <p>Competition exists, and this is also evident during job searching. It is common for an employer to request an applicant’s Personal blogs, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stark Overflow profile links, or request their inclusion during job applications. As a prepared student, this can be an ice breaker and an opportunity for the employer to see the activities and skills one possesses. Through these avenues, one can practice their skills, which makes it highly an interesting area for employers. Through the GitHub repository and the personal blog, the employer can gauge the activity level and make conclusions on the potential skillset.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that during interviews, one as an applicant can prepare and meet the required selection criteria. Nonetheless, other skills and employment aspects cannot just be deciphered through a 25-to-45-minute interview or extended selection process. This makes reliance on other measures valuable, like the cross-examination of other activities one has been involved in outside. Hence, although sometimes this might not be the main reason for starting Blogging, it can act as an essential tool to showcase one’s skills. And these also come in handy for jobs dealing or associated with significant writing. These include scriptwriters, content writers, editors, and even hired personal bloggers. Getting these job positions will rely highly on showcasing one’s skills, which sometimes goes beyond the personal resume. So, all the best, Blogging.</p>
                        <h3><strong>#5: It is a Place to “Cry”</strong></h3>
                        <p>Yes, when there is nowhere else to cry, take your laptop, open it up, and start typing. Cry as much as you want, and in the end, you will feel better. With the 14-inch screen, and the well elaborate keyboard, as a student, this forms the best opportunity to air one’s desires, to air their frustrations to let the world know what is happening. Overall, this is one of the best places for one to cry. Of course, not literally, but an avenue to share issues, either personal or not.</p>
                        <p>The world has diversified persons, and this means there is always a hearing ear out there. And with life sometimes bringing challenges that seem impossible to bypass, speaking things out is one way to heal. Moreover, with writing one’s blog, better ideas might arise, which in the end makes the frustrations and crying irrelevant in the process. Hence, despite one starting out with sharing frustrations, speaking out to the keyboard before the finalized publishing has the power to shift one’s feelings from bad to worse. In the end, one might realize that despite starting with a bitter writing tone, the future might come out filled with happiness beyond personal comprehension.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Let Us Close It All</strong></h3>
                        <p>Now, what next. We have seen why one needs to start blogging. So, what next. That depends on you, the reader. All I can say is, close this page and start typing. See you there after sharing your blog.</p>               </p>
